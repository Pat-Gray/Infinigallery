üöÄ Project Name: "Infinigallery"
Project Overview
Create an elegant image gallery with infinite scroll that fetches images from the Unsplash API (or a similar image service). The gallery will include features like filtering by category or keyword, lazy loading for better performance, and smooth animations for a seamless user experience.



üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Next.js (for server-side rendering and performance)
Tailwind CSS (for styling)
Intersection Observer API (for infinite scrolling)
Unsplash API (for fetching high-quality images)
React hooks: useEffect, useState, and custom hooks
Debounce (for optimizing search/filter functionality)



‚ú® Features & Functionality

1. Infinite Scroll with Lazy Loading
Use the Intersection Observer API to detect when the user scrolls to the bottom and automatically load more images.
Implement lazy loading for images to reduce initial load times.
2. Image Fetching from Unsplash API
Integrate the Unsplash API to fetch random images.
Display images with information like the photographer's name and download links.
3. Filtering by Category or Keyword
Allow users to filter images by keywords (e.g., "nature," "travel," "architecture").
Use a search bar with debouncing to avoid multiple API calls while typing.
4. Responsive Design
Ensure the gallery is fully responsive using Tailwind CSS so it looks great on all devices.
Adjust the number of columns based on screen size (e.g., 1 column for mobile, 2 for tablets, 3+ for desktops).
5. Smooth Animations
Add smooth fade-in animations when new images load.
Highlight the hovered image with subtle zoom-in and shadow effects.
6. Favorite and Download Features (Optional)
Allow users to favorite images and store them in local storage.
Add a download button for users to save images directly.
7. Accessibility & SEO
Use next/image for optimized images and lazy loading.
Include alt text for all images to improve accessibility and SEO.
